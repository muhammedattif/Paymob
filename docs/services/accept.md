# Requirements

Before starting to use Accept APIs it needs to be configured with your account's secret keys which is
available in your [Accept Dashboard][accept-dashboard]. in `.env` Set the following variables:
```
ACCEPT_API_KEY=<YOUR API KEY>
ACCEPT_HMAC_SECRET=<YOUR HMAC SECRET>
```

After setting up your secret keys, now you will be able to use Accept API interfaces.

# APIs

## - Initialize `AcceptAPIClient`

```python
from paymob.accept import AcceptAPIClient

accept_api_client = AcceptAPIClient()
```

by initializing an object from `AcceptAPIClient` a TCP connection session is established with Paymob server and an `Auth Token` is automatically retrieved.

## - Create Order

You will register an order to Accept's database, so that you can pay for it later using a transaction.
Order ID will be the identifier that you will use to link the transaction(s) performed to your system, as one order can have more than one transaction.

**Example**

```python
from paymob.accept import AcceptAPIClient
from paymob.accept.utils import AcceptUtils

accept_api_client = AcceptAPIClient()

mid_key = "<Type>" # MidKey is useful if you support multiple types of items.
identifier = "<Internal Order ID>"
merchant_order_id = AcceptUtils.generate_merchant_order_id(mid_key=mid_key, identifier=identifier)
amount_cents = 1000
currency = "EGP"

code, order, feedback = accept_api_client.create_order(
    merchant_order_id=merchant_order_id,
    amount_cents=amount_cents,
    currency=currency
)
```

**Parameters**

| `amount_cents` | `Yes` | - |  The price of the order in cents. |
| `currency` | `Yes` | - |  The currency related to this payment |
| `delivery_needed` | `No` | `False` | Set it to be true if your order needs to be delivered by Accept's product delivery services |
| `items` | `No` | `list` |  list of objects contains the contents of the order if it is existing, send it as empty array if it is not available. However, Mandatory for Souhoula and GET_GO payment methods |
| `shipping_data` | `No` | `dict` |  Mandatory if your order needs to be delivered, otherwise you can delete the whole object |
| `shipping_details` | `No` | `dict` |  Mandatory if your order needs to be delivered, otherwise you can delete the whole object |

code, payment_key, feedback = accept_api_client.create_payment_key(
    order_id=order_id,
    amount_cents=amount_cents,
    currency=currency,
    billing_data=billing_data,
    integration_id=integration_id,
)
# NOTE: payment_key is str NOT Object like other APIs

```

from paymob.accept import AcceptAPIClient

accept_api_client = AcceptAPIClient()

payment_key = "<Payment Key>"
identifier = "<Wallet Mobile Number>"
code, transaction, feedback = accept_api_client.proceed_wallet_payment(
    payment_key=payment_key,
    identifier=identifier

# HMAC Validation

Accept callbacks rely on HMAC authentication to verify Accept's identity and integrity of its data.
Every and each callback invoked from Accept's server-side has its own HMAC validation.

So, to authenticate the incoming HMAC all you've to do is to initialize an `HMAC` object and pass `incoming_hmac` and `callback_dict`, it will automatically calculates the HMAC from the Callback Dict and then compares the calculated one againest incoming HMAC, it will return `True` if the HMAC is verified, otherwise it will return `False`.

**Example**

```python
from paymob.accept import HMACValidator

incoming_hmac = "<HMAC sent in query params>"
callback_dict = "<Callback Dict>"
hmac_validator = HMACValidator(incoming_hmac=incoming_hmac, callback_dict=callback_dict
print("Is HMAC Valid: {hmac_validator.is_valid}")
)
```

```bash
Is HMAC Valid: True
```

**Parameters**

| Parameter | Required? | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `incoming_hmac` | `Yes` | HMAC Sent in the Callback Query Params |
| `callback_dict` | `Yes` | Incoming Callback Dict (Request Body) |

# Utility Methods

We've implemented a few methods to help you during the integration/development process.

### - Generate Merchant Order ID

It is a method that builds Merchant Order ID with the following format
```
<MidKey>_<Internal Order ID>__<Current Time>
```

If your merchant supports multiple categories of items, this format will help you to refer this category using the `MidKey` Param.

**Example**

```python
from paymob.accept.utils import AcceptUtils

mid_key = "<Type>"
identifier = "<Internal Order ID>"
merchant_order_id = AcceptUtils.generate_merchant_order_id(
    mid_key=mid_key,
    identifier=identifier
)
```

**Parameters**

| Parameter | Required? | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `mid_key` | `Yes` | Type |
| `identifier` | `Yes` | Internal Order ID |



### - Extract Mid key and Identifier

It allowes you to reverse the previous process

**Example**

```python
from paymob.accept.utils import AcceptUtils

merchant_order_id = "x_1__112233"
mid_key, identifier = AcceptUtils.extract_mid_key_and_identifier(
    merchant_order_id=merchant_order_id,
)
```

The `mid_key` will be `x` and `identifier` will be `1`


### - Create IFrame URL

if you want to proceed with any of the following payment methods:

- **Card**
- **Premium Card Payments**
- **Bank Installments**
- **ValU**
- **SOUHOOLA**
- **GET_GO**
- **Sympl**
- **Forsa**
- **NowPay**

you need to render its `IFrame` to continue the payment process, So all you need to do is to use the following utility method to create the `IFrame URL` 

**Example**

```python
from paymob.accept.utils import AcceptUtils

iframe_id = "<Payment Method IFrame ID>"
payment_key = "<Payment Key>"
iframe = AcceptUtils.create_iframe_url(
    iframe_id=iframe_id,
    payment_key=payment_key
)
```


**Parameters**

| Parameter | Required? | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `iframe_id` | `Yes` | IFrame ID of the payment method [Get it from here][accept-iframes] |
| `payment_key` | `Yes` | Payment Key obtained from [Create Payment Key](#create-payment-key) |


# Handling Callbacks

When your customer performs a transaction or any action related to some transaction "Void, Refund, Pay, etc...", you'd receive callbacks from `Paymob` as a notification after performing any payment process, you would receive a JSON object in POST request which contains a value by which you can know about your payments such as the status of the transaction (success/declined), the order ID related to this transition, the transaction ID and much other information related to your transaction.

There are three types of callbacks:
- **Transaction Callback**
- **Card Token Callback**
- **Delivery Status Callback**

We've added a const class of transaction callback types to make to easy for you to do your checks
and avoid repeating the strings in your code. and you can import it from `constants` and here is an example:
```python
from paymob.accept.constants import AcceptCallbackTypes

AcceptCallbackTypes.TRANSACTION
AcceptCallbackTypes.CARD_TOKEN
AcceptCallbackTypes.DELIVERY_STATUS
```

**Card Token Callback Sample**
```python
{
    "type": AcceptCallbackTypes.CARD_TOKEN,
    "obj" : {
        "id": 10,
        "token": "d20d94...8000687835c3f1a9da9",
        "masked_pan": "xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-2346",
        "merchant_id": 1,
        "card_subtype": "MasterCard",
        "created_at": "2016-12-26T06:49:18.017207Z",
        "email": "test@email.com",
        "order_id": "55"
    }
}
```

**Delivery Status Callback Sample**
```python
{
    "type": AcceptCallbackTypes.DELIVERY_STATUS,
    "obj": {
        "order_id": 5530,
        "order_delivery_status": "Scheduled", 
        "merchant_id": 455,
        "merchant_name": "Test Merchant", 
        "updated_at": "2017-01-24T13:29:40" //iso format datetime
    } 
}
```

**Transaction Callback Sample**

Transaction Callback obj attributes varies depending on the payment method, so you can check it from [Paymob Docs][transaction-callbacks] and we will add samples for each payment method next releases.

<br>

After receiving a callback you must validate it to verify Accept's identity and integrity of its data. We've talked about `HMAC` before, and you can use the example we've talked about in [HMAC-Validation](#hmac-validation) section or you can use `AcceptCallback`.

`AcceptCallback` is a dynamic callback class that takes the callback dict (Transaction, Card Token, or Delivery Status) and the `HMAC` you've received and turns it into a class object with an HMAC validation check, so you don't need to import `HMACValidator` to check it.

**Example:**

```python
from paymob.accept.callbacks import AcceptCallback
incoming_hmac = <HMAC You received>
callback_dict = <Callback you received>
callback = AcceptCallback(
    incoming_hmac=incoming_hmac,
    callback_dict=callback_dict
)
print(f"Callback: {callback}")
print(f"Callback Type: {callback.type}")
print(f"Obj id: {callback.obj.id}")
print(f"HMAC Check: {callback.is_valid}") # Do the HMAC Check
```

**Output:**
```bash
Callback: <paymob.accept.callbacks.transaction_callback.TransactionCallback object at 0x7fcff00cc970>
Callback Type: TRANSACTION
Obj id: 109628234
HMAC Check: True
```
