# Requirements

Before starting to use Accept APIs it needs to be configured with your account's secret keys which is
available in your [Accept Dashboard][accept-dashboard]. in `.env` Set the following variables:
```
ACCEPT_API_KEY=<YOUR API KEY>
ACCEPT_HMAC_SECRET=<YOUR HMAC SECRET>
```

After setting up your secret keys, now you will be able to use Accept API interfaces.

# APIs

## Initialize `AcceptAPIClient`

```python
from paymob.accept import AcceptAPIClient

accept_api_client = AcceptAPIClient()
```

by initializing an object from `AcceptAPIClient` a TCP connection session is established with Paymob server and an `Auth Token` is automatically retrieved.

## Create Order

**Example**

```python
from paymob.accept import AcceptAPIClient
from paymob.accept.utils import AcceptUtils

accept_api_client = AcceptAPIClient()

mid_key = "<Type>" # MidKey is useful if you support multiple types of items.
identifier = "<Internal Order ID>"
merchant_order_id = AcceptUtils.generate_merchant_order_id(mid_key=mid_key, identifier=identifier)
amount_cents = 1000
currency = "EGP"

code, order_data, message = accept_api_client.create_order(
    merchant_order_id=merchant_order_id,
    amount_cents=amount_cents,
    currency=currency
)
```

**Parameters**

| Parameter | Required? | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `merchant_order_id` | `Yes` | - |  Your Internal Order ID |
| `amount_cents` | `Yes` | - |  The price of the order in cents. |
| `currency` | `Yes` | - |  The currency related to this payment |
| `delivery_needed` | `No` | `False` | Set it to be true if your order needs to be delivered by Accept's product delivery services |
| `items` | `No` | `list` |  list of objects contains the contents of the order if it is existing, send it as empty array if it is not available. However, Mandatory for Souhoula and GET_GO payment methods |
| `shipping_data` | `No` | `dict` |  Mandatory if your order needs to be delivered, otherwise you can delete the whole object |
| `shipping_details` | `No` | `dict` |  Mandatory if your order needs to be delivered, otherwise you can delete the whole object |


## Get Order

**Example**

```python
from paymob.accept import AcceptAPIClient

accept_api_client = AcceptAPIClient()

accept_api_client = AcceptAPIClient()

order_id = "<order_id>"
amount_cents = 1000

billing_data = {}
integration_id = "<Your Integration ID>"
code, payment_key, message = accept_api_client.create_payment_key(
    order_id=order_id,
    amount_cents=amount_cents,
    currency=currency,
    billing_data=billing_data,
    integration_id=integration_id,
)

```

**Parameters**

| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `order_id` | `Yes` | - | Order ID retrieved from [Create Order API](#create-order) |
| `amount_cents` | `Yes` | - | The price should be paid through this payment channel with this payment key token |
| `currency` | `Yes` | - | The currency related to this payment |
| `billing_data` | `Yes` | `dict` | The billing data related to the customer related to this payment |
| `integration_id` | `Yes` | `False` | An identifier for the payment channel you want your customer to pay through |
| `card_token_key` | `No` | `str` | Card Token received from token callback if the user choices to save his card information for future payment |
| `expiration` | `No` | `int` | The expiration time of this payment token in seconds. (The maximum is 3600 seconds which is an hour) |
| `lock_order_when_paid` | `No` | `False` | A flag prevent this order to be paid again if it is paid |


## Wallet Payment

After creating the payment key, you may need to processed to `Mobile Wallets` payment, so you need to use the following API to get the `redirect URL`.

**Example**

```python
from paymob.accept import AcceptAPIClient

accept_api_client = AcceptAPIClient()

payment_key = "<Payment Key>"
identifier = "<Wallet Mobile Number>"
code, payment_data, message = accept_api_client.proceed_wallet_payment(
    payment_key=payment_key,
    identifier=identifier
)
```

**Parameters**

| Parameter | Required? | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `payment_key` | `Yes` | - | Payment Key obtained from [Create Payment Key](#create-payment-key) |
| `identifier` | `Yes` | - | Wallet Mobile Number |


## Kiosk Payment

After creating the payment key, you may need to processed to `Kiosk` payment, so you need to use the following API to get the `bill_reference`.

**Example**

```python
from paymob.accept import AcceptAPIClient

accept_api_client = AcceptAPIClient()

payment_key = "<Payment Key>"
code, payment_data, message = accept_api_client.proceed_kiosk_payment(
    payment_key=payment_key,
)
```

**Parameters**

| Parameter | Required? | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `payment_key` | `Yes` | Payment Key obtained from [Create Payment Key](#create-payment-key) |

# HMAC Validation

Accept callbacks rely on HMAC authentication to verify Accept's identity and integrity of its data.
Every and each callback invoked from Accept's server-side has its own HMAC validation.

So, to authenticate the incoming HMAC all you've to do is to use the utility method `validate_processed_hmac`
it will automatically calculates the HMAC from the Callback Dict and then compares the calculated one againest incoming HMAC, it will return `True` if the HMAC is verified, otherwise it will return `False`.

**Example**

```python
from paymob.accept.utils import HMACUtils

incoming_hmac = "<Incoming HMAC sent in query params>"
callback_dict = "<Incoming Callback Dict>"
is_valid = HMACUtils.validate_processed_hmac(
    incoming_hmac=payment_key,
    callback_dict=callback_dict
)
```

**Parameters**

| Parameter | Required? | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `payment_key` | `Yes` | - | Payment Key obtained from [Create Payment Key](#create-payment-key) |

# Utility Methods

We've implemented a few methods to help you during the integration/development process.

### Generate Merchant Order ID

It is a method that builds Merchant Order ID with the following format
```
<MidKey>_<Internal Order ID>__<Current Time>
```

If your merchant supports multiple categories of items, this format will help you to refer this category using the `MidKey` Param.

**Example**

```python
from paymob.accept.utils import AcceptUtils

mid_key = "<Type>"
identifier = "<Internal Order ID>"
merchant_order_id = AcceptUtils.generate_merchant_order_id(
    mid_key=mid_key,
    identifier=identifier
)
```

**Parameters**

| Parameter | Required? | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `mid_key` | `Yes` | Type |
| `identifier` | `Yes` | Internal Order ID |



### Extract Mid key and Identifier

It allowes you to reverse the previous process

**Example**

```python
from paymob.accept.utils import AcceptUtils

merchant_order_id = "x_1__112233"
mid_key, identifier = AcceptUtils.extract_mid_key_and_identifier(
    merchant_order_id=merchant_order_id,
)
```

The `mid_key` will be `x` and `identifier` will be `1`


### Create IFrame URL

if you want to proceed with any of the following payment methods:

- **Card**
- **Premium Card Payments**
- **Bank Installments**
- **ValU**
- **SOUHOOLA**
- **GET_GO**
- **Sympl**
- **Forsa**
- **NowPay**

you need to render its `IFrame` to continue the payment process, So all you need to do is to use the following utility method to create the `IFrame`

**Example**

```python
from paymob.accept.utils import AcceptUtils

iframe_id = "<Payment Method IFrame>"
payment_key = "<Payment Key>"
iframe = AcceptUtils.create_iframe_url(
    iframe_id=iframe_id,
    payment_key=payment_key
)
```


**Parameters**

| Parameter | Required? | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `iframe_id` | `Yes` | IFrame ID of the payment method [Get it from here][accept-iframes] |
| `payment_key` | `Yes` | Payment Key obtained from [Create Payment Key](#create-payment-key) |
